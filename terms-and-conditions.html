               <p><strong>1. Our Mission</strong>.</p>
               <p>Our mission is to create a world where weekends are filled with life. From Boats to Trailers to Side by Sides, browse through millions of Listings to find the ones that fit the way you like to recreate. Learn more about a Listing by reviewing the description and photos, the Host profile, and Guest reviews. If you have questions, just message the Host.</p><br>
               <p><strong>2. Searching and Booking on Autotrain.</strong></p>
               <p>2.1 Searching. You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, Toy type, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and more. Learn more about search results in our Help Center.</p><br>
               <p>2.2 Booking When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Autotrain's Service Fee, offline fees, Taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). You are also agreeing that Autotrain Payments may charge and collect any Security Deposit&nbsp;identified during checkout. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed directly between you and the Host. The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your contract with the Host. Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their Host Services. If processing payment with a credit card the credit card fee is 4%.</p><br>
               <p>2.3 Toy Reservations. A Toy reservation is a limited license to pick up, utilize, return, and use the Toy. The Host retains the right to re-enter the Toy anytime during your booking, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) consistent with applicable law. If you do not return the Toy at the appropriate time, the Host has the right to make you return the toy in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable late return penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests when a guest limit is imposed on the Toy.</p><br>
               <p>2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services. An Experience or other Host Service reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Host Service. You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or use the Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to join a Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.</p><br>
               <p>3. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications..</p><br>
               <p>3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds. In general, if as a Guest you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something outside your control forces you to cancel a reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy. If the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under the Guest Refund Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings; for example Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy. See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.</p><br>
               <p>3.2 Booking Modifications. Guests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Autotrain Platform or direct Autotrain customer service to make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.</p><br>
               <p>Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk.</p><br>
               <p>4.1 Your Responsibilities. You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience or other Host Service. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for returning any Toy (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you received it, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.</p><br>
               <p>4.2 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Autotrain Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 10), including your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, use of any Toy requested, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services. You agree to indemnify Autotrain its owners, operators, and any subsidiary of Autotrain for any legal action or damage caused with respect to the Toys or Services provided through the Autotrain Platform. You further assume full and complete liability for any damage to self, others, or property, including the property rented by you, and the property that you rent out on the site.</p><br>
               <p>Host Terms<br>5. Hosting on Autotrain</p><br>
               <p>5.1 Host. 5.1 Host. As a Host, Autotrain offers you the opportunity to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.</p><br>
               <p>5.2 Contracting with Guests. When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Autotrain Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Autotrain’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking. Autotrain Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms, policies or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.</p><br>
               <p>5.3 Independence of Hosts. Your relationship with Autotrain is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Autotrain, except that Autotrain Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms. Autotrain does not direct or control your Host Service, and you agree that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.<br>&nbsp;</p>
